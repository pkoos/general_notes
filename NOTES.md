# General Notes

This file is going to be a place where I can take notes about the various things I look up and I am curious about. I don't know how this will be organized, so you might need to put on your ADHD goggles!

## man pages

### General Questions

#### What do the numbers in a man page mean?

The numbers are section numbers. Here is what those section numbers mean:

    1   Executable programs or shell commands
    2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
    3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
    4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
    5   File formats and conventions, e.g. /etc/passwd
    6   Games
    7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7), man-pages(7)
    8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
    9   Kernel routines [Non standard]
